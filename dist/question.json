We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.\nVariables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>.

Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`.

The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`. \nVariables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`. \nIf we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`. \n```javascript\nlet name = 'Lydia'\nfunction getName() {\n  console.log(name)\n}\ngetName() // Lydia\n```"},{"id":"628f6091e7f5a5b1797280c8b055e065","title":"112.

In tis case, we pass the `handler` object which contained to properties: `set` and `get`. `set` gets invoked whenever we _set_ property values, `get` gets invoked whenever we _get_ (access) property values.\nThe first argument is an empty object `{}`, which is the value of `person`. To this object, the custom behavior specified in the `handler` object gets added. If we add a property to the `person` object, `set` will get invoked. If we access a property on the `person` object, `get` gets invoked.\nFirst, we added a new property `name` to the proxy object (`person.name = \"Lydia\"`). `set` gets invoked, and logs `\"Added a new property!\"`.\nThen, we access a property value on the proxy object, the `get` property on the handler object got invoked. `\"Accessed a property!\"` gets logged."},{"id":"be54e6f46e3e761f22d227674112f457","title":"136.
